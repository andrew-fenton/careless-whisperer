# Careless Whisperer

Hello hello and welcome to Careless Whisperer, your AI-powered assistant for generating the writings that don't really matter but still need a personal touch.

## Overview
In both academic and professional settings, there are tasks that require personalization but have minimal impact. Think of assignments done just for attendance, cover letters that might not get a second glance, or applications to extracurricular activities. Careless Whisperer is designed to streamline these tasks, making it easier for you to generate personalized content quickly and efficiently.

## Our Vision

### Convenience First

Our initial goal is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that reduces the friction between writers and Language Learning Models (LLMs). Imagine using Careless Whisperer like your everyday ChatGPT, but without needing to open the app. Instead, you can provide input through text or voice directly from a Chrome extension. Our backend will select the best LLM for each task and keep track of your preferences to improve future responses.

We are currently at this stage and are excited to launch our MVP to the public soon.

### Use Your Writing to Improve Your Writing 

The next step involves creating a portal to store and classify your past writings—cover letters, class assignments,... so that we can replicate your style as closely as possible. This phase will introduce additional steps like creating login credentials and addressing potential privacy concerns, which is why we’ve planned it for later.

## Timeline and Goals
We set a challenging goal to deliver a robust MVP within one month, coinciding with the end of our internships and the start of recruiting season. Our aim is to enhance our technical understanding and execution abilities through this project.
