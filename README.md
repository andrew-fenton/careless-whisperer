Careless Whisperer

Hello hello there and welcome to Careless Whisperer aka your AI generator for the writings that don't really matter.

Throughout our academic and professional lives, we realize that there are things that need to be personalized, but don't really affect anything. Think the assignments for only for attendance, cover letters that no one will ever read, application to  extracurriculars,etc....

Ideally, Careless Whisperer is here to solve that. Imagine if you only need to highlight the question, say 2-3 sentences to describe how you would answer it and receive the text, in your own writing style, right away.

Are we there yet? Not quite. But here is the 2-step plan:

1. Conveniency
First, we want to build an MVP that reduces the friction between LLMs and writers.

Think of it as your everyday ChatGPT but you don't have to open the app, and have the option to state how you would answer via text or voice. This is why we decided to build it as a chrome extension.

The backend will work to decide the best LLM to use for that task, and keep context of what you liked and worked for you before.

We are currently here and are about to launch our MVP to the public.

2. Use your writing to make your writing
We will now have a portal to keep and classify your past writings: cover letter, class assignments,...so that we can replicate it as close as possible!

This would require additional steps of creating log in credentials and potential privacy problem, which is why we wanted to build it later.

We set ourselves up with the task to have as good of an MVP as possible in 1 month, right at the end of our internships and at the beginning of recruiting season. We hope this enhanced learning experience would help with our technical understanding and ability to execute.

If you have read all of this, thank you!
